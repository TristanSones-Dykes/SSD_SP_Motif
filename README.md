# Yeast motif, GPI anchor, Signal Peptide (SP) analysis

The purpose of this repo is to create a pipeline for the analysis of secretory pathway proteins in a variety of yeast species. We will be using SignalP_6 for SP location, NetGPI for GPI anchors, and R (Bioconductor) to collate findings and do motif and hydrophobicity analysis.
